 # Bugz000 Soundboard

 > A quick soundboard in AHK

this code is god  awful, but it does work in some capacity, it does also have the ability to use the inbuilt windows TTS engine to generate completely novel voice lines though specific operation of that feature has been omitted in this case for simplicity.
i put this up simply because discord is preventing users putting their own sounds up for private calls, so i made this to circumnavigate that stupid paywall, and i hope it can help others
it is unique in that it has a categorisation feature, so you can have hundreds of sounds and be able to find the exact sound you want in only 3-4 keypresses
there is keybinds for changing category pages ( numpad * and - ) and keybinds for pages within categories ( numpad + and enter ) - this way you can easilly "pan" across to the category you want and skip to the page you want, and the 3x3 grid corresponds with the numpad keys 1-9.
this means within 4 keypresses you have had direct access to 36 sounds, and from any of those you have had access to a further 90 with only one further keypress from any point

HOWEVER the software is absolutely not polished, it has many bugs, not much stuff is configurable, i need to remake the ui and i'd love to have an unsigned audio driver to push the audio to
and sadly, it also only supports WAV files for now 

should anyone like to take this concept further either with my codebase or something completely novel, please let me know.

 ## About me

 living in the UK, avid hobbyist!

 enjoying all aspects of life, photography, archery, motorcycling, aquariums, astronomy, and ofcourse, computers!

 I have been coding AHK and been an active member of the AHK irc community for over 10 years.

 my main passion being speed, ease of use, efficiency, batch and parallel processing within ahk.

 ## Donations

 i just do this for fun, mainly because i hate charging people money for my work as we all have different financial means, so i always prefer to "charge" people however much it is worth to them, maybe it's $10, maybe it's $0! it doesn't matter! so long as this software isn't put out of your reach simply due to money, like other more greedy developers!
 for this reason, none of my assistance or software costs money, and it never will! it's all free, with no adverts other than a single convenient, unobtrusive "support me" link.

 Any money we receive will go straight towards bettering my sons life in any way we can!
